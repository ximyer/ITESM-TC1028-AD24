## Objective:

Create a Python program that performs basic financial calculations such as calculating the total cost, discounts, tax, and final price for a shopping cart.

## Requirements:

**1. Shopping Cart Calculation:**
The program should take input for the price and quantity of multiple items.Calculate the total cost of the items.

**2. Discount Calculation:**
Apply a discount to the total cost if a certain condition is met (e.g., total cost exceeds a specific amount).

**3. Tax Calculation:**
Calculate the tax on the total cost after the discount is applied.
Use a fixed tax rate (e.g., 8%).

**4. Final Price Calculation:**
Calculate the final price by adding the tax to the discounted total cost.


## Reasoning: ðŸ’­

#### Input
- Name of items
- Price per item
- Quantity of items
- Discount

#### Output
- Price of items (subtotal)
- Taxes of items given the subtotal
- Total price of items

#### Process
- Ask the client for their 5 products (name, price, quantity)
- Calculate the subtotal of the items
- Ask for a discount
- Calculate the discount
- Calculate a new price with the discount
- Calculate the taxes of the items
- Calculate the total price of the items
