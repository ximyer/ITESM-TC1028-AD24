## Exercise 2: Simple Interest Calculator 🧮

 
### Input

- Principal Amount
- Annual rate of interest
- time period in years

### Process

For loop x5 times:

- print ‘Client #’
- Input: principal amount
- input: annual rate of interest
- Input time period in years:
- calculate the interest with: `(Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.`

Save the results in a dictionary? 

Based on the dictionary print results of: 

1. Which is the lowest simple interest? `min`
2. Which is the highest simple interest? `max`
3. Display the 5 simple interests calculated `dictionary`
4. What is the average of the simple interests `sum/len`

 
## Test Case:

#### CLIENT 1️⃣:

1) Enter the principal amount: 1000
2) Enter the annual rate of interest (%):5
3) Enter the time period (years): 3
4) Simple Interest: 150.00


#### CLIENT 2️⃣:

1) Enter the principal amount: 6743
2) Enter the annual rate of interest (%): 3
3) Enter the time period (years): 7
4) Simple Interest: 1416.03


#### CLIENT 3️⃣:

1) Enter the principal amount: 46875
2) Enter the annual rate of interest (%):5
3) Enter the time period (years): 4
4) Simple Interest: 9375


#### CLIENT 4️⃣:

1) Enter the principal amount: 7624
2) Enter the annual rate of interest (%): 1
3) Enter the time period (years): 5
4) Simple Interest: 381.2


#### CLIENT 5️⃣:

1) Enter the principal amount: 23460
2) Enter the annual rate of interest (%): 9
3) Enter the time period (years): 4
4) Simple Interest: 8445.6



### OUTPUTS: ❓

1) Which is the lowest simple interest?
150.00

2) Which is the highest simple interest?
9375

3) Display the 5 simple interests calculated:
150.00,
1416.03,
9375,
381.2,
8445.6,


4) What is the average of the simple interests:
19767.83/5 = 3953.566
