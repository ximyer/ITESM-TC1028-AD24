## Computational Thinking for Engineering ðŸ’»

At the end of the unit the student:

- Demonstrates the behavior of systems in engineering and sciences through empirical and theoretical evidences obtained from diverse research and computational methodologies.

- Evaluates the components that integrate a problem according to principles and processes related to engineering sciences.

- Makes decisions in the solution of problems under conditions of uncertainty and different levels of complexity based on research methodologies.

- Implements scientific and engineering actions or computational processes that comply with the type of solution required.

- Applies standards and norms in the exercise of their profession keeping them as a reference to follow in the solution of engineering and science problems.
